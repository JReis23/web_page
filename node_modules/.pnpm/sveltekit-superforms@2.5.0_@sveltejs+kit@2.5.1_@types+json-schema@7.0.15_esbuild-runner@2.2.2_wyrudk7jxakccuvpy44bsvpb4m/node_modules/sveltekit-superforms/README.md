# Feature list

- Server- and client-side validation with your favorite validation libraries, and more to come: ðŸ’¥ **Arktype** ðŸ’¥ **Joi** ðŸ’¥ **TypeBox** ðŸ’¥ **Valibot** ðŸ’¥ **VineJS** ðŸ’¥ **Yup** ðŸ’¥ **Zod** ðŸ’¥
- Seamless merging of `PageData` and `ActionData` - Forget about which one to use and how, just focus on your form data.
- [Auto-centering and focusing](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/error-handling#usage-client) on invalid form fields.
- [Tainted form detection](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/tainted), prevents the user from losing data if navigating away from an unsaved form. Or use [snapshots](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/snapshots) to save the form state.
- Automatically coerces the `FormData` into correct types.
- For advanced data structures, forget about the limitations of `FormData` - Use [nested data structures](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/nested-data) transparently.
- Generates [default form values](https://superforms.rocks/default-values) from validation schemas.
- Handles [multiple forms](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/multiple-forms) on the same page.
- Works both on the server and with [single-page applications](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/spa) (SPA)!
- [Proxy objects](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/proxy-objects) for handling data conversions to string and back again.
- Realtime [client-side validation](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/client-validation) for the best possible UX.
- Create loading spinners easily with three [auto-updating timers](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/timers), based on human perception research.
- Hook into [a number of events](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/events) for full control over the validation data and the `ActionResult`, with a possibility to cancel the update at every step.
- Complete customization with a [huge list of options](https://superforms.rocks/api#superformform-options).
- No JavaScript required as default, but full support for [progressive enhancement](https://superforms.rocks/concepts/enhance).
- Comes with a Super Debugging Svelte Component: [SuperDebug](https://superforms.rocks/super-debug).
